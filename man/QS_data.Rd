\title{Query and Summarize NASS Data for a Specific Year}
\usage{
QS_data(YEAR)
}
\arguments{
\item{YEAR}{A numeric value indicating the year for which the data should be summarized.}
}
\value{
A list containing three dataframes: `binned_operations`, `binned_irrigated_area`, and `County_Summary`.
}
\description{
This function processes NASS data to produce summaries for a given year. It generates three separate dataframes:
one for county summaries, one for binned operations, and one for binned irrigated areas. It filters data for the specified year,
counts the number of counties with irrigation data by farm size, and constructs summary tables for operations and acreage by size bins.
}
\examples{
# Assuming nass_binned is available in your environment:
result <- QS_data(2022)
binned_operations <- result$binned_operations
binned_irrigated_area <- result$binned_irrigated_area
County_Summary <- result$County_Summary
}
