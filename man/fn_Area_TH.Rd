\title{Calculate Area Thresholds and Non-Reported Irrigation}
\usage{
fn_Area_TH(threshold, YEAR)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{Numeric; the threshold value used to categorize data into under and over threshold groups.}

\item{YEAR}{Character; the year identifier used in naming the output CSV file.}
}
\value{
Invisible. Although the function does not explicitly return a value, it modifies
  global variables and may write to a CSV file as a side effect.
}
\description{
This function processes a list of operations, merging them with a dataset based on size bins,
and calculates various statistics related to area per operation and threshold values for irrigation.
It categorizes data into under and over threshold values, computes percentages of non-reported irrigation
areas, and prepares a final summary of these calculations. The summary data frame is globally stored
and optionally written to a CSV file.
}
\details{
The function modifies the global variable `Non.Reported` with the final data frame and
  optionally writes this data frame to a CSV file named based on the `YEAR` parameter.
  These actions are considered side effects of the function execution.
}
\note{
The function uses `dplyr` for data manipulation and `magrittr` for the pipe operator.
It assumes `operations_list` and `dat_D_filled` are available in the global environment.
The function is designed to work within a specific data processing workflow and may need adjustments
for use in other contexts.
